## Anselm's Node Navigation

For this project I used these technologies/libraries:

React<br />
TypeScript<br />
React Testing Library<br />
Jest<br />
ESLint<br />
SCSS

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run lint`

Analyzes the codebase using the airbnb coding standard.<br />
FYI: There are two that didn't get a chance to work on.
